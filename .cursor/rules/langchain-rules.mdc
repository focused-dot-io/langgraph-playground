We are building example code for langchain and langgraph. Some specifics to remember:

- Each file is an independently runnable script that demonstrates a function of LangChain and LangGraph
- Use uv to run scripts
- Code should be explicit and not too clever
- Always use the latest LangChain and LangGraph, check their documentation regurally
- Prefer LangGraph over raw LangChain
